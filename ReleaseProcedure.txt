RGBD Release TODO List:

To create a release, the general strategy is to start with the last release and upate the files changed

Building the release:
Build new version for Windows and OS X.

For both operating systems, go through the whole process from calibrating, capturing visualizing and exporting to be sure no weird bugs snuck in.

When you're sure it's ready, update the changelog and README with the new version number (1) and any workflow changes from this new version
For each platform:
	-- Copy the old release folders 
	-- Replace application files, and README files, and shaders in both the with and without example data folders

Make sure that when you open the app with example data, that the example compsition loads automatically.


Creating a source package
With each release, the full source code needs to be uploaded as well. To prepare the sourc release:
	-- copy the entire openFrameworks source folder
	-- delete everything but the following directories:
		openFrameworks/libs
		openFrameworks/apps
		openFrameworks/addons




1) Note about RGBDToolkit version numbers: This is modeled roughly after how the openFrameworks version numbers work. 
RGBDToolkit preRelease 00XY

X is the major release, and is incremented whenever a significant change has been made to the toolkit. During the pre release period it is OK to break project compatibility with old projects when releasing a new major version

Y is the minor version. Releases that are intended to fix bugs or small problems, compatibility should remain intact with the current major version.
